The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known and commonly used datasets in the field of machine learning and statistics. In this article, we will explore the Iris dataset in deep and learn about its uses and applications.

What is Iris Dataset?
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. It was introduced by the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
